  The story of Marcos, the octo-potato man. Marcos was born on July 
4th, 1997 in Ireland. Ever since a child, Marcos loved potatoes. His mom 
would offer him steak, eggs, corn, rice, but Marcos just wanted to eat 
potatoes. He loved baked potatoes, boiled potatoes, french fries, potato 
chips, potato pancakes, or anything that has potatoes. Marcos later went on 
to study agricultural engineering at the University of Oxford. 15 years 
later he developed the Octo-Potato! Here is the story on how Marcos learned 
to create octo-potatoes.

	Early in his studies, he found the properties of octopuses very interesting.
So he decided that he should make the best of both worlds. The octo-potato. A potato
that had 8 spuds attached to it. A creation worthy of God himself Marcos thought. 
Many called him a mad man, others called him a monster. But Marcos pushed through
and made his dream reality. Years of intensive research later, it was born. Marcos 
immediatly tried to cook his creation, and found it delicous. Marcos octo-potato
became known around the world as the best potato. He even won a nobel prize for the creation of this potato.
